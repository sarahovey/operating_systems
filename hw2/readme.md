# Homework 2: Adventure

This assignment is a simple game. 

The buildrooms file randomly generates 6 rooms from a set of possible rooms, and creates the edges of a graph that represents connections between them, including a start and end.
The adventure file prompts the user to navigate the rooms, and declares when you've reached the end.

This was done in c99.
